                <p>
                    Intellectual Property does not have particularly strong ties to the movie Everything Everywhere
                    all at once (EEAO). In the movie, there is no point in which trademarked symbols play a significant
                    role, or copyrights stop characters from doing something, or patents protect some sort of mechanism
                    or device, or trade secrets stop the characters from learning something they needed to know. In fact,
                    the ultimate everything bagel that forms the main structure of the movie is fully revealed to the
                    protagonist by the villain. So although there is no mention of these topics in the movie, in the
                    spirit of multiverses, we can pretend that there is a multiverse in the movie in which the device
                    the protagonists use to jump bodies into different multiverses is given intellectual rights by its
                    makers. Deconstructing the property rights it may have had, it would likely have been a trade
                    secret; they would not want just anyone getting their hands on the technology that allows you to
                    jump into different universes and gain the skills of that multiverses version of you. Because it
                    would be a trade secret, it likely would not have been patented or copyrighted. In order to copyright
                    or patent something, great details need to be provided on that thing, so that it can be determined
                    whether or not a copyright or patent on said thing has been broken. For a trade secret, the
                    protagonists likely would have wanted to preserve as much information on their techniques as possible.
                    On the other hand, the antagonists in this story are depicted by a circle shape on their foreheads.
                    This symbol could be trade marked by the antagonists, if they so pleased.
